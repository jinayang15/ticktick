# to-do-or-not-to-do

To do/Not To Do List app

Goal: Replicate TickTick's To-do feature and eventually add in the calendar feature (because I hate subscriptions)

To do list (haha):

_# of stars out of 5 = perceived difficulty_

- [x] Develop a fully working console version of a to-do list app
- [x] Add in UI elements
- [ ] Rig everything up with JS
  - [ ] Refactor the addToSection functions to make more sense... `*`
  - [ ] Add priority and dates in properly `**`
  - [ ] Attach data attributes to elements corresponding to the list/task in memory for easy access `*`
  - [ ] Allow for tasks to be edited `**`
  - [ ] Allow for lists to be added/deleted `***`
  - [ ] Allow for tasks to be added/deleted `****`
  - [ ] Lists for today, next 7 days, and all tasks `**`
  - [ ] UI Touchups `*`
  - [ ] Sort alphabetically/by date/priority `**`

Notes:

- Doing the console version was kind of unnecessary this time
- Why did the UI take me so long
