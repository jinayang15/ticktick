# TickTick

### Clone of TickTick To Do List App

### Goal: Replicate TickTick's To Do feature and eventually add in the calendar feature (because I hate subscriptions)

#### To do list (haha):
###### _# of stars out of 5 = perceived difficulty_
- [x] Develop a fully working console version of a to-do list app
- [x] Add in UI elements
- [ ] Rig everything up with JS
  - [x] Refactor the addToSection functions to make more sense... `*`
  - [x] Add priority and dates in properly `**`
  - [x] Attach data attributes to elements corresponding to the list/task in memory for easy access `*`
  - [x] Allow for tasks to be edited `**`
  - [x] Allow for lists to be added/deleted `***`
  - [x] Allow for tasks to be added/deleted `****`
  - [x] Lists for today, next 7 days, and all tasks `**`
  - [ ] UI Touchups `*`
  - [ ] Reorganize code so that display controller doesn't control everything

##### Notes:
- Doing the console version was kind of unnecessary this time
- Why did the UI take me so long
